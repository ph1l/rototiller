- Split out the rendering functions into their own listings, consolidate into
  a single main, it'd be neat to just have a bunch of rendering plugins for eye
  candy you can select on the commandline.

- Replace the dirty mess of libdrm calls with a flexible drm setup thingy, so
  the user can choose the crtc/encoder/connector/mode etc.  It's all hard-coded
  currently, requiring you to go change ~3 lines to make it display on an
  external monitor for example.

  I'd like a commandline interface for selecting the outputs, an interactive
  text one for navigating the drm topology and selecting what you want would be
  a nice alternative as well.

- Figure out if it's possible/how to page flip and synchronize multiple crtcs
  at once.  Can we have a drm program running discrete effects on multiple
  monitors, in a tear-free fashion on all of them?  I think this is actually a
  complicated problem they're struggling to deal with in X/weston land general
  multihead.
